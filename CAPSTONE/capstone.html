                    Attention Seeker is a smart app that will sound the alarm whenever a User falls asleep while
                    reading.
                    Most of the time, on exam days students study for a long time. Some time
                    while studying our eyes close unintentionally. When they awake, it was too late to complete the
                    whole syllabus. And he doesn’t know how to complete whole the syllabus and therefore he takes the
                    stress and due to this, it became a burden on his mind and he doesn’t know what he should be done.
                    due to mental stress, he feels laziness and uncomfortable and when he appears in the exam paper due
                    to stress he can’t attempt the paper truly and due to this he finally fails. So to avoid this, we
                    are creating an app that will sound the alarm whenever you fall asleep while reading. So that we
                    should wake up because of this alarm and complete our course by focusing on study so that we can
                    avoid mental stress .

                <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A common reason to fail the student is because of sleepiness during the
                    study. To identify sleep patterns and frequency of daytime and assess the association between sleep
                    duration and academic performance. Daytime sleepiness and irregular schedules are highly preventing
                    common college students or university students. As 50% report daytime sleepiness and 70% attain
                    insufficient sleep. The consequence of sleep deprivation and daytime sleepiness are especially
                    problematic to college students can result in lower grade point averages College students,
                    specifically first-year students, are extremely sleep deprived, with approximately
                    25% of students reporting less than six hours of sleep per night (Lund, Reider, Whiting, & Prichard,
                    2010). This statistic is alarming given that the average 18-year-old requires approximately 8.5 h of
                    sleep for optimal functioning (National Sleep Foundation, 2013).Sleep habits and problems play a
                    vital role in determining sleep quality. We describe sleep habits
                    and problems among medical students and assess their possible effect on self-reported academic
                    performance. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study among medical students at the University
                    of Ghana during the 2014/2015 academic year. Data was collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
                    Index (PSQI), a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval.
                    Results. 153 medical students were recruited comprising 83 (54.2%) females and 70 (45.8%) males with
                    a mean age of 23.1 ± 2.4 years. The mean duration of night sleep was 5.7 ± 1.2 hours; 88 (57.5%)
                    students had sleep latency of 10-30 minutes while 18 (11.8%) woke up nightly. 23 (15%) students
                    experienced nightmares, 13 (8.5%) snored at night, and only one student reported a coffee intake of
                    2-3 times daily. Sleep quality was poor in 86 (56.2%) and was significantly associated with sleep
                    latency, morning tiredness, daytime sleepiness during lectures, academic performance, living
                    conditions, leisure time, frequency of nocturnal awakenings, waking up due to noise, sleepwalking,
                    and nocturnal awakening to use the washroom. There was also a significant positive relation
                    The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among
                    Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aimed at identifying the
                    determinants of depression and anxiety. A total of 476 university students living in Bangladesh
                    participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey. A standardized e-questionnaire was generated
                    using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media—Facebook. The information was
                    analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
                    Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly
                    had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary
                    logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI =
                    0.961–8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic
                    period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736–1.952). It is expected that both the government
                    and universities could work together to fix the academic delays and financial problems to reduce
                    depression and anxiety among university students.
